# Astral-Baiting-Scripts

I am fully aware that this is a total bastardization of the FLUX Architecture, and I love it for that.

Rhost users make calls that will call these scripts.
These scripts run stuff, seperately from the MUSH, then report back to it using Rhost's API.

##Installation

`npm install` and hook up the commands to execscript() calls that will call the index with the right environmetal variables.
